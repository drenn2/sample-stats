# Illinois PS Stats
Shared resources for stats for students in Political Science at the University of Illinois. This repository contains materials for students in the methods sequence, as well as general tutorials. Use this space to collaborate on exploration assignments, practice pull requests, and help each other.  

For example:  
- Have a question about an exploration? Submit a new issue and everyone can contribute!

## Workshops and Tutorials
*__Aug 26__ - Basic Markdown for reproducible research and using git for classwork and assignments  
*__Sept 2__ - APSA weekend. Send questions via email and/or work together. There is also the [**ATLAS** lab][atlas], which staffs a help desk for R and other stats/programming-related issues. David Bowden is a PhD student in Political Science who currently works there.  
*__Sept 9__ - We will start with a review of using git and Rmarkdown to help create some more uniformity in exploration submissions. Let's separate the meeting time with the first hour (3:00-3:50) for PS530 students and the next hour (4:00-4:50) being for PS531 students. As always, bring your questions about the weekly assignment.  
*__Sept 16__ - Same meeting time as last week. Please send questions in advanced, if you can. No special topic this time around as most people seem busy enough with the explorations. Note that there are some examples with loops in PS530 student's [dailyR](https://github.com/bowers-grad-stats-illinois/dailyR) repository, in case that's helpful for some of your work this week. @ps531 students, remember that you have a paper for this class and should schedule time to talk to Jake about your papers as soon as you have a topic and data.  
*__Sept 23__ - No workshop topic this week. I'll be available from 3:00-4:50PM on Friday to answer specific questions about readings or explorations. If you have specific questions, please post an issue or send an email. A reminder that you may want to change group compositions periodically to get the most out of the exploration assignments.

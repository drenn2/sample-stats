# Get Ready
We will work through several topics today to equip you to use some basic tools used in both PS530 and PS531. Beyond the course, these tools will help you produce reproducible research and collaborate with others. Here is a brief outline of our time:  

1. I will walk you through the process of cloning this repository onto your machine. If you haven't done so already, register for a github account and install git on your machine.  
2. We will look at the default markdown template and practice writing a document in Rmarkdown using the countries dataset.  
3. You will submit a pull request after you alter your countries-codebook tasks.  
4. You may review the process (especially as it relates to your exploration assignments) by looking at the git-clone-pull file/  
5. If you have questions about your exploration assignments, we will discuss them at the end of the workshop. Before we do this, join/get enrolled into our classroom's organization and the 'students' group for access to versions of the explorations in Markdown.
